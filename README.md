F.A.Q.
How can I book a sports field?                            
Choose the most suitable field for you on the main page of the application, go to its page, select the appropriate date and time for booking, and then pay a deposit for the booking.
How is the booking payment processed?                                
Payment is made online using a card. To confirm your booking, you will need to make a deposit equal to 10% of the total cost.
Can I change the date and time of my booking?                     
If you want to change the date or time of your booking, you need to cancel the previous booking and make a new booking for the field.
Can I cancel my booking?                           
Yes, you can cancel your booking, but no later than 3 hours before the start of the reserved time.
Will I get a refund for my deposit if I cancel my booking?                          
No, the deposit is not refunded when you cancel your booking.
What should I do if I can't find available time for booking?                            
The available hours are shown on the page of each field. If the time you need is not displayed, it means that all the hours are already booked. You can check another field or come back later to see if new available hours have opened up.
How can I contact you?                         
You can only contact us through the Telegram chat in the application.
